features were selected by looking at the correlation amongst the variables as well as performing PCA.
k-fold cross validation performed on the dataset where k = 10.
two logistic regression models were made: one with just the selected variables, the other with the selected variables + PCA.
logistic regression models were used to predict values.

next steps:
Naive bayes model, Decision tree model
Create a confusion matrix for each model
Evaluate the models using precision, accuracy and recall
